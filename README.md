bacnet
======

A Haskell library for encoding bacnet data

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michaelgwelch/bacnet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michaelgwelch/bacnet)

Provides BACnet.Reader and BACnet.Writer modules with primitive readers and writers.

Currenlty only builds on ghc 7.6. There are considerable package conflicts as 
I try to support ghc 7.8
