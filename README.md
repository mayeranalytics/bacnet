bacnet
======

A Haskell library for encoding bacnet data

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michaelgwelch/bacnet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michaelgwelch/bacnet)

Notes: In my source, you'll see both Monad style of programming and Applicative.
This is a learning exercise for me so I took advantage of both. And when using
the Monad style, I generally avoided the "do" syntax but occasionally used it.

I imagine if I stick with this project long enough, I'll eventually develop some
consistency of sytle. For now, I enjoy learning how to use the different functions
in each module.
